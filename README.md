*Job Prediction Agent Based on Skills and Location*


*Overview*

This project is a job prediction agent that recommends job titles based on a user's skills and location. The agent uses a simple GUI built with Tkinter and leverages machine learning techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, to predict the most suitable job title.

*Features*

- User-friendly GUI with input fields for location and skills
- Job database with sample job titles, locations, and required skills
- TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity-based job prediction
- Displays predicted job title in a larger window with a close button

*Requirements*

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

*Usage*

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-prediction-agent.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd job-prediction-agent`
3. Run the application: `python job_prediction_app.py`

*How it Works*

1. The user inputs their location and skills in the GUI.
2. The agent filters jobs based on the location and calculates the similarity between the user's skills and job skills using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
3. The agent predicts the top matching job title and displays it in a larger window.

*Future Improvements*

- Integrate a larger job database with more diverse job titles and locations
- Improve the accuracy of job prediction by using more advanced machine learning techniques
- Add more features, such as job description and salary range, to the job database and GUI
